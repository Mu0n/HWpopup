December 9th, 2017 X-Wing Vassal news

The X-Wing Vassal League home website is now officially live at this address: http://xwvassal.info

KNOWN BUGS:
-Chopper astromech will not be counted (1 point) during autospawn - beware of the squad point total
-The sheathipede-class shuttle action icons (shift-a) are not rotated with the ship's rotation but are otherwise functioning
-the TIE Silencer maneuver reference card shows the bank 3 moves as white but they are green. The dial, ordered open dial, ordered strip are all ok though.
